# Aim: Hello World and Calculator program
# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:
In C++, input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.

+ Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device (for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.
  
+ Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device (display screen) then this process is called output.
  
All of these streams are defined inside the <iostream> header file which contains all the standard input and output tools of C++. The two instances cout and cin of iostream class are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++.

<ins>Standard Output Stream - cout</ins>:
The C++ cout is the instance of the iostream class used to produce output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen. The data needed to be displayed on the screen is inserted in the standard output stream (cout) using the insertion operator(<<).

<ins>Standard Input Stream - cin</ins>:
The C++ cin statement is the instance of the class istream and is used to read input from the standard input device which is usually a keyboard. The extraction operator (>>) is used along with the object cin for extracting the data from the input stream and store it in some variable in the program.

# Implementation:
The basics i.e input and output functions and basic arithmatic operators (more is discussed in the next part) of C++ are seen through the following programs,
+ Hello World(Printing Hello World)
+ Making a simple calculator

# Conclusion:
The basics of C++ was seen through the programs.
